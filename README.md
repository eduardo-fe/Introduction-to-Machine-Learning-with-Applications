# Introduction to Machine Learning Methods for Policy Analysis.

This repository contains materials for a **three-lecture introductory course** on core Machine Learning (ML) methods, with an emphasis on applications in policy evaluation. 

The course is designed for researchers, students, and practitioners who want to gain hands-on skills with modern ML tools, starting from the fundamentals and progressing towards causal estimation techniques.

## ðŸ“š Course Overview

### **Lesson 1 â€” Regression & Regularisation**
- Linear regression as a predictive model.
- Overfitting, biasâ€“variance trade-off.
- Penalised regression methods:
  - Ridge Regression (L2)
  - Lasso (L1)
  - Elastic Net
- Practical examples of model selection and tuning.
- Cross-validation for hyperparameter optimisation.

### **Lesson 2 â€” Tree-Based Methods**
- Decision trees for regression and classification.
- Ensemble methods:
  - Random Forests
  - Gradient Boosted Trees (e.g., XGBoost, LightGBM)
- Variable importance and partial dependence plots.
- Strengths, weaknesses, and common pitfalls.

### **Lesson 3 â€” Introduction to Double/Debiased Machine Learning**
- Concept of nuisance parameters in causal inference.
- Neyman orthogonality as a motivation for DML.
- Cross-fitting to reduce overfitting bias.
- Simple DML examples combining ML learners with causal estimators.
